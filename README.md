# STARTHACK2022

## Introduction
EWOR is building the next challenge-driven learning environment that helps individuals turn their ideas and expertise into companies. Our coaching, network and education platform gives aspiring founders everything they need to design and deliver impactful ventures.

## The Challenge
Ensure that your solution is economically effective and efficient, promotes positive social change and is environmentally sustainable. We evaluate your solution based on the social, environmental and economic impact it has.

## Resources:
To meet the evaluation criteria, the below frameworks can be used. Consider these frameworks to develop your solution taking into account economic, social and sustainability dimensions.

### Triple Bottom Line - People/Planet/Profit
In economics, the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) states that companies should commit to considering social and environmental issues as much as their profits. TBL theory holds that there is not just one bottom line, but three: profits, people, and the planet. A TBL seeks to measure the degree of a company's commitment to social responsibility and its impact on the environment over time.

### Desirability, Feasibility, Viability: The Sweet Spot for Innovation
The process of identifying the most critical underlying assumptions of your idea and translating those into early prototypes can feel overwhelming. To break down these tasks, it is often helpful to view prototyping through different lenses which forces you to think about your ideas and prototyping from multiple perspectives.

* A desirable solution that the customer really needs.
* A feasible solution that builds on strengths and operational capabilities.
* An economical solution with a holistic, sustainable integrative project management model.

### Useful Sources
For assessing the impact, we recommend that you link it to one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations (https://sdgs.un.org/goals) and define an interesting metric (e.g. CO2 reduced) to measure the impact of your solution. For assessing your economical impact, you might want to report market size, business model, and competitive landscape, or anything that you would see in a typical pitchdeck. A helpful article on this topic was written by our founder: https://ewor.io/blog/how-to-build-a-strong-pitch-deck-a-step-by-step-guide-with-examples/

## Judging Criteria
We evaluate the solution based on several areas:
* Economic: Your solution should have key performance indicators (KPIs), generate value, and critical business decisions should be carefully chosen.
* Impact: Your solution should make an impact according to at least one of the dimensions below:
  * Social: The commitment to social areas should include all stakeholders (internal and external) of the solution OR
  * Sustainable: The solution is evaluated according to its environmental impact.
